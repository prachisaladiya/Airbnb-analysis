# Data Cleaning & Outlier Handling
To ensure accurate analysis and cleaner visual insights, I performed the following key data cleaning steps:


1. Price Outlier Detection:

   Outliers were first detected using two standard statistical methods:
   Z-Score Method → Identified 317 outliers
   IQR (Interquartile Range) Method → Identified 2,070 outliers (~5% of total data)

Since Airbnb price data is right-skewed (heavily concentrated on lower prices with a few extreme highs), the IQR method was chosen as the primary approach.

-- Why this matters:
   Removing these extreme price points helped prevent misleading trends and ensured clearer, more accurate visualizations — especially for metrics like average price and price vs. reviews.


2. Created a New Column: Status

   A new column named Status was added to label listings as:

  "Active" if availability_365 > 0
  "Inactive" if availability_365 = 0

This allowed me to analyze active vs. inactive listings without removing or altering the original data.

-- Why this matters:
   By segmenting active and inactive listings, I was able to generate deeper insights into which boroughs have more inactive properties and which listings may need intervention or cleanup.
